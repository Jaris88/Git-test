    <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
      <p>
        This is a really simple dish to prepare and itâ€™s always a big hit at
        parties. My father recommends:
        <blockquote> Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend.
          Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter,
          try serving it warm. </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em>  excited about a new cooking
      technique called <i>sous vide.</i>  In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge
      the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath
      that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
      food to be cooked to. 
      <br> 
      In his book, <cite> Cooking for Geeks,</cite> Jeff
      Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q> </p>
      <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
        Hollandaise.</b>  To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
      before <time>November 30.</time></p>

        if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small> </p>
